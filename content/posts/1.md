I finally got off my butt and finally created a website. Do I get a 🍪? 

In all seriousness, I've been inspired by my incredibly smart coworkers to put more effort into coding, making it more a passion rather than a career, I'm hoping I can turn this website into a learning experience, and hopefully work on a couple of other side projects or trying out something like [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). My knowledge is lacking in so many ways so here's to hoping I can start working towards not being a total idiot at work! 🍻🍻🍻
